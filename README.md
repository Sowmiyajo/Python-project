# Python-project
This project focuses on the application of Deep Learning techniques for the neuroimage segmentation of brain anatomy. Using Python, advanced machine learning models are trained to segment MRI and CT brain scans, allowing for the precise extraction of anatomical structures such as the cortex, white matter, and gray matter. The goal is to improve the accuracy of medical imaging analysis and contribute to research in neurology, diagnostics and brain health.

Key features include:
- Efficient Segmentation Models: Utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning architectures (such as U-Net and 3D CNNs) for precise segmentation of brain structures.
- Data Augmentation: Implements techniques like rotation, flipping, and scaling to enhance model robustness and generalize to diverse datasets.
- Preprocessing and Postprocessing: Performs preprocessing steps like normalization, denoising, and resizing of MRI/CT images to improve segmentation accuracy.
- Evaluation Metrics: Implements metrics like Dice Coefficient, Intersection over Union (IoU), and accuracy to evaluate the performance of segmentation models.
- Visualization: Provides tools to visualize segmentation results and the anatomical structures identified from the brain scans.

- This project serves as a tool for medical professionals, researchers, and data scientists interested in leveraging deep learning to analyze brain anatomy and improve the diagnosis and understanding of neurological conditions.
